# Sand-Go

## Proof of Concept: Learning Go Basics

This project is a simple proof of concept designed to help learn the basics of the Go programming language. It is not intended for production use.

## What is Sand-Go?
Sand-Go is a basic simulation of falling sand, implemented using the Go programming language and the Termbox library for terminal rendering.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a learning tool for Go programming basics, such as:

- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, for loops, etc.)
- Functions and function calls
- Error handling
- Basic data structures (arrays, slices, etc.)

## How to Run
To run the simulation, simply execute the sand.go file using the Go compiler:

```bash
go run sand.go <number_of_sand_particles>
```

Replace ```<number_of_sand_particles>``` with the desired number of sand particles to simulate.

## Notes
- This project is a simplified example and is not intended to be a realistic simulation of falling sand.
- The Termbox library is used for terminal rendering, which may not work correctly on all systems.
-This project is not intended for production use and should not be used as a reference for production-quality code.
